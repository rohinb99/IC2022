# VEO e-scooters have made traveling across campus convenient, enhanced student life and have sustainable goals of reducing fossil fuel consumption. These also have reduced students’ loads of walking across campus, or worse, waiting for university shuttles. But these come along with safety concerns as students ride on the sidewalks posing high risk to the walking pedestrians. Our goal is to reduce the number of infractions by imposing rules on riding on sidewalks and come up with safety measures for both the pedestrians as well as the riders. We combined sidewalks and rides’ datasets to analyze the number of rides taking place on sidewalks. We also compared data from September and November to find common regions where the most number of infractions had occurred. We further deep-dived into the specifics of why a sidewalk was most frequented. The high frequency of rides on sidewalks could possibly be attributed to factors like an important building nearby such as Adele H. Stamp, a good number of bus-stops around, construction sites hampering the roads nearby, narrow roads making it unsafe for novice riders. Looking into all these insights, we think a few steps that can be taken to improve the concerned issue are- geofencing the no-ride zones, monetary fine in terms of a factor of the number of sidewalks crossed over during a ride, construction-free campus unblocking a lot of roads.
